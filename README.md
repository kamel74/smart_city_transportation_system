# Cairo Traffic and Transit Management System

## Description
Flask app for Cairo's traffic & transit management using NetworkX. Models city graph, simulates traffic, optimizes emergency & transit routes with A* pathfinding. Visualizes with Folium/Matplotlib, offers dashboard for analysis, node/edge edits, and result downloads to enhance urban mobility.

## Features
- **Graph Modeling**: Represents Cairo's neighborhoods and transit stops using NetworkX.
- **Traffic Simulation**: Simulates traffic flow based on time and capacity.
- **Routing**: A* algorithm for emergency and transit route optimization.
- **Visualization**: Interactive maps with Folium and plots with Matplotlib.
- **Dashboard**: Analyzes traffic, emergency response, and transit performance.
- **Data Management**: Add/remove nodes/edges, save/load JSON data.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
